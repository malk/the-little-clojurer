# the-little-clojurer

My personal Jab at doing [the little schemer][] in Clojure, like legions of
others before me.

This version tries to remain as close as possible to the source material,
doing the things like the book does when possible, it is Clojure only in the
sense that it is valid Clojure syntax, once I finish this I shall do another
version using idiomatic Clojure as much as possible.
