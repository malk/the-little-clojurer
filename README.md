# the-little-clojurer

Yet another Jab at doing [the little schemer][] in Clojure. (is a rite, you
should just do it too).

The idea (as in the book) is to teach recursion, the Y combinator and using
them to build a lisp interpreter.

Using as little as possible of the language itself, no constructs, no
libraries, just the functions created in the book and the the primitives
they need.

Will not teach you clojure (and the book did not taught scheme).

Only contains my answers, not the content of the book itself, and
should make no sene without the book. I wanted to respect the author's
